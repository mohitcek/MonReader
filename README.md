This project develops a machine learning model for classification tasks in the field of computer vision. In the notebook, a three-layer CNN model is trained on the low-resolution images of a book from the mobile. The trained model extracts the relevant features and patterns from the low-resolution image and classifies them as 'flip' and 'not flip'.
